# School_District_Analysis

## Overview
Analyze an entire school district to determine the following results:
* Average math and reading scores by students in each grade.
* School performance based on budget per student.
* School performance based on school school size.
* School performance based on type of school.
* Determine the top 5 and bottom 5 schools based on overall passing rates.

After the analysis had been completed there was concern that the grades of ninth graders at Thomas High School had been altered.  The school board was interested to see how the potentional academic dishonesty would affect the district overall. The analysis was run a second time excluding the grades of all ninth graders at Thomas High School.
